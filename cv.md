## Code Examples

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

```
function (number){
  let sum = 0;
  
  for(let i = 1; i < number; i++){
    if(i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0){
      sum += i
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
```
